/*
Given an array of positive integers nums and a positive integer target, 
return the minimal length of a subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to target. If there is no such subarray, return 0 instead.
*/







/* 
Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without duplicate characters.
*/






/*
You are given a string s and an array of strings words. All the strings of words are of the same length.

A concatenated string is a string that exactly contains all the strings of any permutation of words concatenated.

For example, if words = ["ab","cd","ef"], then "abcdef", "abefcd", "cdabef", "cdefab", "efabcd", and "efcdab" are all concatenated strings. 
"acdbef" is not a concatenated string because it is not the concatenation of any permutation of words.
Return an array of the starting indices of all the concatenated substrings in s. You can return the answer in any order.
*/





/*
Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window substring of s 
such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string "".

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.
